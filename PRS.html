        <p>Welcome to my paper rock scissor game. 
            This is a very small project to practice my coding skills. 
            Most of the CSS attributes used are just for learning experience, 
            and not for overall asthetic pleasure. 
        </p>
        <p>Directions: Click one of the three buttons (paper, rock, or scissors). 
            This will be your choice. The computer will also make the same choice. 
            Whoever wins will receive a point. 
            The first player to reach 5 points will win the game.
